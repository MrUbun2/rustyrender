horrible rendering engine made by some guy who has no clue what he's doing

this is by far my largest project, and i am honestly surprised i got this far. i don't actually know much about rendering engines so i'm sure this one will suck, but i'll try to get it running the best i can!

pull requests are always welcome (unless they're stupid :3)
